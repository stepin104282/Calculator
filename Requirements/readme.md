**4W1H Question**

What?

A calculator is a small hand-held computer that performs mathematical operations. Some calculators even permit simple text editing and programming.

When?

Usually people use calculators in everyday life to save their time and to get accurate answers while doing calculations.

Where?

Many times, in scientific and mathematical calculations involving complex operations with complicated numbers, the calculations are not feasible because it will take a lot of time and there are many chances of getting errors when done manually.

Why?

To make calculations easier.

How?

The memory chips inside the calculator contain thousands or millions of bytes program code that allows the calculator to do work.

**Low Level Requirements for Modulo Division Function**:
